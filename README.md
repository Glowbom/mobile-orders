## Tech Stack

We used Swift (SwiftUI) and Kotlin (Jetpack) for mobile, JavaScript and Materialize CSS for the web front end, and Apps Script for the backend. The mobile apps code is written using the latest frameworks recommended by Apple and Google.

Mobile Orders for iOS made using Swift 5 and SwiftUI. The Android version created with Kotlin, Jetpack, MVVM, Room, Retrofit, RxJava, and Data Binding.
